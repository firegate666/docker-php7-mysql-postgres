How to use?
===========

First add the project as a submodule:

    git submodule add https://github.com/firegate666/docker-php7-mysql-postgres.git ./docker
    git submodule init
    git submodule update --remote

Afterwards enter the docker folder and enter

    PORT="8976" DOCROOT="web" docker-compose up --build
    
to start the machine. PORT is the exposed port where you can access you application and DOCROOT points to /app/DOCROOT on the machine where /app is mounted to the parent of this docker folder.
    
Now you can access the databases from within your project by talking to 'mysql' or 'postgres' as host.

Try

    docker exec -it web_app_postgres psql -U myapp
    
or

    docker exec -it web_app_mysql mysql --user=myapp --password --host=localhost myapp
    
The internal php server fires up the application and makes it accesible on the docker ip on port "as configured above". 
If unsure you can use docker-machine to get the IP address. 

To enter you machine you can exec

    docker exec -it web_app bash
    
then you are logged in as user. Your machines might have gotten a different name than this. You can always use "docker ps" to get a list of running containers and there name or specify a custom container name by setting "--name SOMETHING" when executing "docker-compose run".

The folder above you docker folder is mounted to /app, the webroot points to /app/web, this should be configurable in the future.

e.g.:

    http://192.168.64.4:8976/
