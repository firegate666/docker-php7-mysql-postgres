How to use?
===========

First add the project as a submodule:

    git submodule add https://github.com/firegate666/docker-php7-mysql-postgres.git ./docker
    git submodule init
    git submodule update --remote

Afterwards enter the docker folder and enter

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose run -e PORT="8000" -e DOCROOT="web"
    
to start the machine.
    
Now you can access the databases from within your project by talking to 'mysql' or 'postgres' as host.

Try

    docker exec -it docker_postgres_1 psql -U myapp
    
or

    docker exec -it docker_mysql_1 mysql --user=myapp --password --host=localhost myapp
    
The internal php server fires up the application and makes it accesible on the docker ip on port "as configured above". 
If unsure you can use docker-machine to get the IP address. 

To enter you machine you can exec

    docker exec -it docker_web_1 bash
    
then you are logged in as user.

The folder above you docker folder is mounted to /app, the webroot points to /app/web, this should be configurable in the future.

e.g.:

    http://192.168.64.4:8000/
